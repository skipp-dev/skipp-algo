## September 2026

### Tables in the bottom panel

Users can now move tables drawn by a script into a separate tab in the chart’s bottom panel. To move a script’s tables to the panel, open the “More” menu in the script’s status line and select the “Move tables to bottom” option. To move the tables back to the chart, select “Move tables to chart” from the “More” menu or from the context menu opened at the top of the panel’s tab.
Tables in the bottom panel have different positioning and cell-sizing rules from those on the chart. All tables stack vertically in order from first to last, regardless of the `position` and `force_overlay` arguments of each `table.new()` call. The cells of each table also stretch as necessary to fit the allocated width and height within the pane, without truncating the displayed text. Additionally, users can select and copy the text from tables in the bottom panel, unlike tables displayed on the chart.
See the Displaying tables in the bottom panel section of the Tables page to learn more about this feature and how it works.

### Improved line wrapping in square brackets

We’ve improved the line wrapping behaviors for code within square brackets (`[ ]`). Previously, all line-wrapped history-referencing operations or tuples required indenting each line after the first by any number of spaces that was not a multiple of four. The only exception was for square brackets enclosed in a set of parentheses, because code within parentheses can contain any amount of indentation, whether zero or a multiple of four spaces.
We’ve extended the indentation flexibility for code in parentheses to all code between square brackets. Now, wrapped code within square brackets can use any amount of indentation without restriction. For example:


## August 2026

### Pine Screener improvements

We’ve made two improvements to the Pine Screener: adding indices as a symbol source option, and making the full “Indicators” dialog box available when selecting an indicator script for the screener.
Previously, the Pine Screener could scan symbols only from a user’s watchlist and use indicators only from the user’s “Favorites” list.
Now, users can scan the symbols of any index using the Pine Screener, without first creating a watchlist of those symbols. Select the “Index” tab in the “Symbol source” dropdown menu to choose an index and scan up to 4,000 of its symbols. Clicking the “Add indicator” button now opens the “Indicators” dialog box. Users can select personal, invite-only, purchased, built-in, or community scripts to use with the Pine Screener. Note that the Pine Screener supports only indicator scripts that contain at least one `plot*()` or `alertcondition()` call; if a script is not compatible with the screener, it is grayed out in the “Indicators” dialog box and cannot be selected.
Refer to the Pine Screener key features and requirements article in our Help Center to learn more about the Pine Screener.

### ​once​ conditional structure

We’ve added a new `once` keyword. It defines a conditional structure that executes a block of code when its condition evaluates to `true`. After the local block executes for the first time on a closed bar, it does not execute again on any subsequent bars, regardless of the condition. For more information, see the `once` structure section of the Conditional structures page.

### Binary search in UDT arrays

The `array.binary_search()`, `array.binary_search_leftmost()`, and `array.binary_search_rightmost()` functions can now search arrays that store IDs of user-defined types (UDTs). Like the sorting functions for UDT collections, these functions include a `sort_field` parameter, which specifies the object field that a call compares while searching. The parameter accepts a “const int” field index (0 by default, referring to the first field in the type declaration) or a “const string” field name. Note that the array must be sorted by the same field, in ascending order, for the search to return correct results.


## July 2026

### Strategy improvements

We’ve added a parameter to the `strategy()` declaration statement for defining a new calculation behavior: `calc_on_every_history_tick`. An argument for this parameter must include the parameter’s name (e.g., `calc_on_every_history_tick = true`). If the value is `true`, the script executes once for each available tick in every historical bar. As the script executes on a historical bar, the values of built-in price and volume variables, such as `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`, update on each tick to approximate the data that was available when the bar was still developing. This behavior allows for more granular calculations and order fills across a chart’s history, while also reducing the risk of lookahead bias in the simulation. This new feature is available on standard charts for users with Premium and Ultimate plans. See the Altering calculation behavior section of the Strategies page to learn more.
We’ve also made multiple changes to the “Settings/Properties” tab and the strategy report interface (formerly known as the Strategy Tester), including the following:
- The strategy report and the “Properties” tab now include a Script execution menu, where users can customize the strategy’s allowed executions. The `calc_on_every_tick`, `calc_on_every_history_tick`, and `calc_on_order_fills` parameters of the `strategy()` statement define the default settings enabled in this menu.
- The former “Using bar magnifier” checkbox has been changed to a new Bar detalization menu, which is available in the “Properties” tab and at the top of the strategy report. This menu replaces the Bar Magnifier feature; it controls the level of intrabar detail available for filling orders and updating calculations on historical bars. The `use_bar_magnifier` parameter defines the strategy’s default “Bar detalization” setting. See the Adjusting historical bar detail section of the Strategies page to learn more.
- The former “Fill orders using standard OHLC” checkbox for specifying whether a strategy uses real prices on Heikin Ashi charts has been replaced by a “Heikin Ashi mode” dropdown input. The input appears in the “Properties” tab only while the strategy runs on a Heikin Ashi chart. The `fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc` parameter defines the default state of this input.
- The former “Verify price for limit orders” input in the “Properties” tab has been replaced by a “Limit order execution” dropdown input, with a fixed set of options for defining assumptions about unfilled limit orders. Programmers can still specify an alternative default assumption by including a `backtest_fill_limits_assumption` argument in the declaration statement.
- The checkbox for filling orders immediately after creating them on a bar’s closing tick has been replaced by an “Order execution delay” input. The default state of the input is still defined by the declaration statement’s `process_orders_on_close` parameter.
- The “Margin for long positions” and “Margin for short positions” inputs in the “Properties” tab have been replaced by “Long leverage” and “Short leverage” inputs, allowing users to define a specific level of leverage for the strategy rather than calculating margin percentages. However, for backward compatibility, the `strategy()` function still includes `margin_long` and `margin_short` parameters, which define the strategy’s default margin percentages directly. The strategy converts the arguments to leverage quantities and displays the converted values in these new inputs. See the Margin and leverage section of the Strategies page for more information.
Refer to the Strategies page to learn more about the current features of strategy scripts and the updated user interface.

### Automatic parentheses

We’ve improved line wrapping functionality in the Pine Editor. When a programmer presses the `Enter` key to break part of a single-line expression and wrap it across lines, the editor now automatically encloses the expression in a pair of parentheses. This improvement reduces the need to insert indentation or parentheses manually when wrapping a single-line expression after writing it. For example:


## April 2026

### Multiline strings

We’ve added support for multiline strings. A multiline string is a literal “string” value enclosed by three pairs of quotation marks (e.g., `"""..."""`) or apostrophes (e.g., `'''...'''`). Unlike single-line string syntax (e.g., `"..."`), which typically defines a literal string on a single line of code, the multiline syntax can define a literal string across multiple visible code lines.
All code between the `"""` or `'''` delimiters in a multiline string definition represents literal text. Each code line between the delimiters defines a separate text line for the string. The resulting string automatically includes the newline control character between each separate line; it does not require the `\n` escape sequence to insert the character at those points. For example:
Likewise, multiline strings automatically include all spaces used for indentation in the code, regardless of the code blocks that include their definitions. For example:
Expressions can use multiline strings as operands and arguments, just like single-line strings. Therefore, programmers can use the multiline string syntax to create unique line wrapping formats in their code. For example:
See the Multiline strings section of the Strings page to learn more about multiline strings and how they differ from single-line strings.

### Updated editor settings

The Pine Editor’s settings include a new “Use word wrap by default” checkbox. If selected, the Pine Editor automatically applies word wrapping when the user creates a new script, opens an existing script, or reopens the editor. The user can deactivate or reactivate word wrap for the current editor session at any time by using the `Alt + Z`/`Option + Z` hotkey or the “Toggle Word Wrap” option in the command palette.

### Sorting UDT collections

The `array.sort()`, `array.sort_indices()`, and `matrix.sort()` functions can now sort arrays and matrices that store IDs of user-defined types (UDTs). These functions sort UDT collections by comparing values from one of the “int”, “float”, or “string” fields in the objects referenced by their elements.
The new `sort_field` parameter specifies which object field a call to these functions compares to sort a UDT collection. It accepts either a “const int” or “const string” argument:
- A “const int” argument specifies a field by its field index, where a value of 0 (the default) refers to the first field in the type declaration.
- A “const string” argument specifies a field by its assigned name.
For example:
Refer to the Sorting arrays of user-defined types section of the Arrays page and the Sorting matrices of user-defined types section of the Matrices page to learn more about sorting UDT collections and the `sort_field` parameter.


## January 2026

### Footprint requests

We’ve added a new `request.footprint()` function and two new data types, `footprint` and `volume_row`. These features enable scripts to retrieve and work with volume footprint data for a chart’s dataset:
- The `request.footprint()` function requests volume footprint information for the current bar. It returns either the reference (ID) of a `footprint` object, or `na` if no footprint data is available for the bar.
- A `footprint` object contains the available volume footprint data retrieved for a specific bar. Scripts can use IDs of this type with the new `footprint.*()` functions to retrieve a bar’s overall footprint information, such as its total “buy” or “sell” volume and overall volume delta, or to retrieve `volume_row` IDs for individual rows within the footprint, including those for the bar’s Point of Control (POC) and Value Area (VA) boundaries.
- A `volume_row` object contains data for a specific footprint row. Scripts can use IDs of this type with the new `volume_row.*()` functions to retrieve a footprint row’s information, including its price levels, volume values, volume delta, and imbalances.
Programmers who have a Premium or Ultimate plan can use these features to create scripts that analyze volume footprint information across bars or perform custom footprint-based calculations. For example:
See the `request.footprint()` section of the Other timeframes and data page to learn more about footprint requests. For more information about the `footprint` and `volume_row` types and the functions in their namespaces, refer to the footprint and volume_row section of the Type system page.


## December 2025

### Updated line wrapping

Scripts now have improved line wrapping behavior. Previously, all multiline text representing a single line of code required indenting each line after the first by any number of spaces that was not a multiple of four, because Pine reserved four-space indentation for local code blocks.
We’ve removed the indentation restriction for all parts of an expression or statement enclosed in parentheses, including operations, function calls, and function parameter declarations. Scripts can now indent wrapped lines enclosed in parentheses by zero or more spaces, including multiples of four. For example:
However, if a line-wrapped expression is not enclosed in parentheses, all subsequent lines still require an indentation that is not a multiple of four spaces. For example:


## November 2025

### —

We’ve added a new variable, `syminfo.isin`, which holds a string containing the 12-character International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) for the security represented by the symbol, or an empty string if no ISIN is available. An ISIN uniquely identifies a security globally and does not vary across exchanges, unlike ticker symbols. As such, programmers can use this variable to identify a symbol’s underlying stock or other instrument, regardless of the name listed by an exchange. For example:


## October 2025

### —

The `time()` and `time_close()` functions feature a new parameter: `timeframe_bars_back`. In contrast to the `bars_back` parameter, which determines the bar offset on the script’s main timeframe for the timestamp calculation, `timeframe_bars_back` determines the bar offset on the separate timeframe specified by the `timeframe` argument. If the `timeframe_bars_back` value is positive, the function calculates the timestamp of the past bar that is N bars back on the specified timeframe. If negative, it calculates the expected timestamp of the bar that is N bars forward on that timeframe.
If a call to `time()` or `time_close()` includes arguments for both the `bars_back` and `timeframe_bars_back` parameters, it determines the timestamp corresponding to the `bars_back` offset first. Then, it applies the `timeframe_bars_back` offset to that time to calculate the final timestamp. For example:


## September 2025

### —

The `plot()` function can now draw dotted and dashed lines via the new `linestyle` parameter, which takes one of the following arguments: `plot.linestyle_solid`, `plot.linestyle_dashed`, or `plot.linestyle_dotted`. The `linestyle` parameter setting takes effect only for `style` arguments that plot lines.


## August 2025

### —

We’ve updated the maximum length for strings. Previously, a “string” value could not exceed 4,096 characters. Now, strings can contain up to 40,960 encoded characters.

### Pine Editor changes

The Pine Editor is moving from the bottom panel to the side panel. This change will happen in phases over the following weeks.
By default, the new editor view overlays on the right side of the screen. For wider screens, a split-view mode is available, which automatically adjusts the chart’s width to keep it visible alongside the editor. With this new vertical orientation, users can easily edit code and view other tabs such as the “Strategy Tester” or “Replay Trading” tabs at the same time.
The vertical editor view includes a word wrap feature, which enables users to read or modify long lines of code without scrolling horizontally. Note that word wrapping is only a visual feature; it does not change the source code’s structure or line numbering. Users can activate or deactivate word wrapping with the `Alt + Z`/`Option + Z` hotkey.


## July 2025

### —

All `input*()` functions feature a new parameter: `active`. This parameter specifies whether users can change the value of the input in the “Settings/Inputs” tab. If `true`, users can change the input’s value. If `false`, the input is grayed out, and users cannot change the value. Programmers can use this parameter to define inputs whose states depend on the values of other inputs. For example:
We’ve added a new `syminfo.*` variable:
- `syminfo.current_contract` – The ticker identifier of the underlying contract, if the current symbol is a continuous futures contract; `na` otherwise.


## June 2025

### —

Libraries can now export user-defined constant variables. Exported variables must be of the “int”, “float”, “bool”, “color”, or “string” type and include the `const` keyword in their declaration. For example:


## May 2025

### —

The `time_close` variable and the `time_close()` function have improved behavior on tick charts and price-based charts (Renko, line break, Kagi, point & figure, and range). On chart types that are not time-based, the closing time of the open realtime bar is knowable only after the bar closes. Therefore, the value of `time_close` and `time_close()` is always `na` for that bar.
Previously, it was impossible to use expressions such as `time_close[1]` or `time_close("", 1)` to retrieve the closing timestamp of an elapsed realtime bar on these chart types. These expressions always returned `na` when they referenced a realtime bar, because the bar’s timestamp was not saved after the closing tick.
With this new update, the closing timestamp of a realtime bar on tick charts or price-based charts is always available immediately after the bar closes. Now, scripts can use `time_close` with the `[]` history-referencing operator or call `time_close()` with a positive `bars_back` argument to retrieve the closing times of elapsed realtime bars on any chart type. For example:


## April 2025

### —

The `style` parameter of the `ticker.renko()`, `ticker.pointfigure()`, and `ticker.kagi()` functions accepts a new argument for box sizing: `"PercentageLTP"`. When a call to these functions uses this `style` argument, the returned ticker ID refers to a non-standard chart dataset with box sizes based on a user-defined percentage of the last trading price.


## March 2025

### —

We’ve added a setter function for boxes: `box.set_xloc()`. It is similar to the `*.set_xloc()` functions for lines and labels. The function sets the left and right coordinates of the box borders, and defines whether their values represent bar indices or UNIX timestamps.

### For loop updates

The `for` loop structure has updated boundary-checking behavior. Previously, any `for` statement established the loop counter’s end boundary (`to_num`) before starting the first iteration, and the final possible counter value could not change during the loop’s execution. Changing the result of an expression used as a `for` loop’s `to_num` argument inside the local scope did not affect the loop’s iteration range.
Now, a `for` loop evaluates the `to_num` boundary dynamically, before every iteration. With this update, the loop statement can modify its stopping condition after any change to the `to_num` argument’s result across iterations.
To learn more about this new behavior, refer to the `for` loops section of the Loops page and the Dynamic `for` loop boundaries section of the v6 migration guide.


## February 2025

### —

We’ve removed the scope count limit. Previously, any script’s total number of scopes, including the global scope and all local scopes from user-defined functions and methods, loops, conditional structures, user-defined types, and enums, was limited to 550. Now, scripts can contain an indefinite number of local scopes from these structures.
We’ve introduced two new built-in variables, `bid` and `ask`, providing access to real-time market prices:
- `bid` - represents the highest price an active buyer is willing to pay for the instrument at its current value.
- `ask` - represents the lowest price an active seller will accept for the instrument at its current value.
These variables are only available on the `"1T"` timeframe. On other timeframes, their values are `na`.


## December 2024

### —

The `strategy.exit()` function has updated calculation behaviors. Previously, calls to this command with arguments for the absolute and relative parameters defining a price level for the same exit order always prioritized the absolute parameter and ignored the relative one. For example, a call with specified `limit` and `profit` values always ignored the `profit` value. Now, the command evaluates both related parameters and uses the level that the market price is expected to activate first. See this section of the v6 migration guide for more information.


## November 2024

### Introducing Pine Script v6

Pine Script has graduated to v6! Starting today, future Pine updates will apply exclusively to this version. Therefore, we recommend converting existing v5 scripts to access new features as we roll them out. See our migration guide to understand the changes to existing Pine behaviors and learn how to convert scripts to v6.
Several new features and behaviors come with this version’s release:
- Scripts can now call `request.*()` functions with “series string” arguments for the parameters that define the requested context, meaning a single `request.*()` call can change its requested data feed on any historical bar. Additionally, it is now possible to call `request.*()` functions inside the local scopes of loops, conditional structures, and exported library functions. See the Dynamic requests section of the Other timeframes and data page to learn more.
- Values of the “bool” type are now strictly `true` or `false`. They are never `na` in v6. Additionally, the `or` and `and` operators now feature short-circuit (“lazy”) evaluation. If the first expression of an `or` operation is `true`, or the first expression of an `and` operation is `false`, the script does not evaluate the second expression because it is not necessary to determine the result. These improvements help boost the runtime efficiency of scripts that rely on “bool” values and conditional expressions.
- The `size` property of labels and the `text_size` property of boxes and tables now support “int” values in addition to the `size.*` constants. These “int” values represent sizes in typographic points, offering a more granular and wide range of text size possibilities.
- The new `text_formatting` parameter of the `label.new()`, `box.new()`, and `table.cell()` functions determines whether the object’s displayed text is bold, italicized, or both. It accepts one of these three new `text.*` constants: `text.format_bold`, `text.format_italic`, `text.format_none`. To modify a drawing object’s `text_formatting` property, use the corresponding `*set_text_formatting()` functions.
- Strategies no longer stop calculating and raise an error when they reach the 9000 trade limit while not using Deep Backtesting mode. Instead, they trim the oldest orders to make space for new ones. The trimmed orders are not visible in the strategy report, but that does not change the strategy’s simulation. To retrieve the trade index of the earliest non-trimmed order, use the `strategy.closedtrades.first_index` variable.
- The `array.get()`, `array.set()`, `array.insert()`, and `array.remove()` functions now support negative `index` arguments to reference elements starting from the end of an array. For instance, the call `array.get(myArray, -2)` retrieves the second to last element in `myArray`, which is equivalent to `array.get(myArray, array.size(myArray) - 2)`.
- The new `syminfo.mincontract` variable holds a value representing the smallest number of contracts/shares/lots/units required to trade the current symbol, as set by the exchange.
- Two new variables, `syminfo.main_tickerid` and `timeframe.main_period`, reference the ticker ID and timeframe from the script’s main context, even if the script uses them in the `expression` argument of a `request.*()` call. Here, “main context” refers to the current chart’s symbol and timeframe, unless the script is an `indicator()` that includes `symbol` or `timeframe` arguments in its declaration statement.


## October 2024

### —

We’ve added an optional `behind_chart` parameter to the `indicator()` and `strategy()` functions. This parameter specifies where plots and drawings appear relative to the main chart display when the `overlay` parameter is `true`. If `behind_chart` is `true`, the script’s visuals appear behind the chart display. If `false`, they appear in front of the chart display. The default is `true`.


## August 2024

### —

The `ticker.new()` and `ticker.modify()` functions feature two new parameters: `settlement_as_close` and `backadjustment`. Users can specify whether these parameters are on, off, or set to inherit the symbol’s default settings. These settings only affect the data from futures symbols with these options available on their charts. They have no effect on other symbols.
- The `backadjustment` parameter specifies whether past contract data on continuous futures symbols is back-adjusted. Its possible values are: `backadjustment.on`, `backadjustment.off`, or `backadjustment.inherit`.
- The `settlement_as_close` parameter specifies whether a futures symbol’s `close` value represents the actual closing price or the settlement price on “1D” and higher timeframes. Its possible values are: `settlement_as_close.on`, `settlement_as_close.off`, or `settlement_as_close.inherit`.
The Sharpe and Sortino ratios in the Strategy Tester module have updated calculations. Previously, the ratios used strategy returns over monthly periods if the trading range was three or more months and daily periods if the range was three or more days but less than three months. Both ratios now always use monthly periods for consistency.


## June 2024

### —

We've added a new parameter to the `box.new()`, `label.new()`, `line.new()`, `polyline.new()`, and `table.new()` functions:
- `force_overlay` - If true, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false.

### Pine Script Enums

Enums, also known as enumerations, enumerated types, or enum types, are unique data types with all possible values declared by the programmer. They can help programmers maintain more strict control over the values allowed by variables, conditional expressions, and collections, and they enable convenient dropdown input creation with the new input.enum() function. See our User Manual's Enums page to learn more about these new types and how to use them.


## May 2024

### —

We've added an optional `calc_bars_count` parameter to the `indicator()`, `strategy()`, `request.security()`, `request.security_lower_tf()`, and `request.seed()` functions that allows users to limit the number of recent historical bars a script or data request can execute across. When a script's `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement includes a `calc_bars_count` argument, its “Settings/Inputs” tab will include a “Calculated bars” input in the “Calculation” section. The default value in all these functions is 0, which signifies that the script or request executes across all the available data.
The `strategy.*` namespace features several new built-in variables:
- `strategy.avg_trade` - Returns the average amount of money gained or lost per trade. Calculated as the sum of all profits and losses divided by the number of closed trades.
- `strategy.avg_trade_percent` - Returns the average percentage gain or loss per trade. Calculated as the sum of all profit and loss percentages divided by the number of closed trades.
- `strategy.avg_winning_trade` - Returns the average amount of money gained per winning trade. Calculated as the sum of profits divided by the number of winning trades.
- `strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent` - Returns the average percentage gain per winning trade. Calculated as the sum of profit percentages divided by the number of winning trades.
- `strategy.avg_losing_trade` - Returns the average amount of money lost per losing trade. Calculated as the sum of losses divided by the number of losing trades.
- `strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent` - Returns the average percentage loss per losing trade. Calculated as the sum of loss percentages divided by the number of losing trades.

### Pine Profiler

Our new Pine Profiler is a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all significant code in a script and displays helpful performance information next to the code lines inside the Pine Editor. The Profiler's information provides insight into a script's runtime, the distribution of runtime across significant code regions, and the number of times each code region executes. With these insights, programmers can effectively pinpoint performance bottlenecks and ensure they focus on optimizing their code where it truly matters when they need to improve execution times.
See the new Profiling and optimization page to learn more about the Profiler, how it works, and how to use it to analyze a script's performance and identify optimization opportunities.

### Pine Editor improvements

When opening the detached Pine Editor from a tab with a chart, it now links directly to that tab, as indicated by the “Linked” status and green icon in the bottom-right corner. While linked, the “Add to chart”, “Update on chart”, and “Apply to entire layout” buttons affect the charts on the main tab.
The detached Pine Editor now includes the Pine console.


## April 2024

### —

We've added a new parameter to the `plot()`, `plotchar()`, `plotcandle()`, `plotbar()`, `plotarrow()`, `plotshape()`, and `bgcolor()` functions:
- `force_overlay` - If true, the output will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane.


## March 2024

### —

The `syminfo.*` namespace features a new built-in variable:
- `syminfo.expiration_date` - On non-continuous futures symbols, returns a UNIX timestamp representing the start of the last day of the current contract.
The `time()` and `time_close()` functions have a new parameter:
- `bars_back` - If specified, the function will calculate the timestamp from the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on its timeframe. It can also calculate the expected time of a future bar up to 500 bars away if the argument is a negative value. Optional. The default is 0.


## February 2024

### —

We've added two new functions for working with strings:
- `str.repeat()` - Constructs a new string containing the source string repeated a specified number of times with a separator injected between each repeated instance.
- `str.trim()` - Constructs a new string with all consecutive whitespaces and other control characters removed from the left and right of the source string.
The `request.financial()` function now accepts “D” as a `period` argument, allowing scripts to request available daily financial data.
For example:
The `strategy.*` namespace features a new variable for monitoring available capital in a strategy's simulation:
- `strategy.opentrades.capital_held` - Returns the capital amount currently held by open trades.


## January 2024

### —

The `syminfo.*` namespace features new built-in variables:
Syminfo:
- `syminfo.employees` - The number of employees the company has.
- `syminfo.shareholders` - The number of shareholders the company has.
- `syminfo.shares_outstanding_float` - The total number of shares outstanding a company has available, excluding any of its restricted shares.
- `syminfo.shares_outstanding_total` - The total number of shares outstanding a company has available, including restricted shares held by insiders, major shareholders, and employees.
Target price:
- `syminfo.target_price_average` - The average of the last yearly price targets for the symbol predicted by analysts.
- `syminfo.target_price_date` - The starting date of the last price target prediction for the current symbol.
- `syminfo.target_price_estimates` - The latest total number of price target predictions for the current symbol.
- `syminfo.target_price_high` - The last highest yearly price target for the symbol predicted by analysts.
- `syminfo.target_price_low` - The last lowest yearly price target for the symbol predicted by analysts.
- `syminfo.target_price_median` - The median of the last yearly price targets for the symbol predicted by analysts.
Recommendations:
- `syminfo.recommendations_buy` - The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a “Buy” rating.
- `syminfo.recommendations_buy_strong` - The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a “Strong Buy” rating.
- `syminfo.recommendations_date` - The starting date of the last set of recommendations for the current symbol.
- `syminfo.recommendations_hold` - The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a “Hold” rating.
- `syminfo.recommendations_total` - The total number of recommendations for the current symbol.
- `syminfo.recommendations_sell` - The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a “Sell” rating.
- `syminfo.recommendations_sell_strong` - The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a “Strong Sell” rating.


## December 2023

### —

We've added `format` and `precision` parameters to all `plot*()` functions, allowing indicators and strategies to selectively apply formatting and decimal precision settings to plotted results in the chart pane's y-axis, the script's status line, and the Data Window. The arguments passed to these parameters supersede the values in the `indicator()` and `strategy()` functions. Both are optional. The defaults for these parameters are the same as the values specified in the script's declaration statement.
For example:


## November 2023

### Pine Script Polylines

Polylines are drawings that sequentially connect the coordinates from an `array` of up to 10,000 chart points using straight or curved line segments, allowing scripts to draw custom formations that are difficult or impossible to achieve using `line` or `box` objects. To learn more about this new drawing type, see the Polylines section of our User Manual's page on Lines and boxes.


## September 2023

New functions were added:
- `strategy.default_entry_qty()` - Calculates the default quantity, in units, of an entry order from `strategy.entry()` or `strategy.order()` if it were to fill at the specified `fill_price` value.
- `chart.point.new()` - Creates a new `chart.point` object with the specified `time`, `index`, and `price`.
- `request.seed()` - Requests data from a user-maintained GitHub repository and returns it as a series. An in-depth tutorial on how to add new data can be found here.
- `ticker.inherit()` - Constructs a ticker ID for the specified `symbol` with additional parameters inherited from the ticker ID passed into the function call, allowing the script to request a symbol's data using the same modifiers that the `from_tickerid` has, including extended session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart types, back-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc.
- `timeframe.from_seconds()` - Converts a specified number of `seconds` into a valid timeframe string based on our timeframe specification format.
The `dividends.*` namespace now includes variables for retrieving future dividend information:
- `dividends.future_amount` - Returns the payment amount of the upcoming dividend in the currency of the current instrument, or `na` if this data isn't available.
- `dividends.future_ex_date` - Returns the Ex-dividend date (Ex-date) of the current instrument's next dividend payment, or `na` if this data isn't available.
- `dividends.future_pay_date` - Returns the Payment date (Pay date) of the current instrument's next dividend payment, or `na` if this data isn't available.
The `request.security_lower_tf()` function has a new parameter:
- `ignore_invalid_timeframe` - Determines how the function behaves when the chart's timeframe is smaller than the `timeframe` value in the function call. If `false`, the function will raise a runtime error and halt the script's execution. If `true`, the function will return `na` without raising an error.
Users can now explicitly declare variables with the `const`, `simple`, and `series` type qualifiers, allowing more precise control over the types of variables in their scripts. For example:


## August 2023

### —

Added the following alert placeholders:
- `{{syminfo.currency}}` - Returns the currency code of the current symbol (“EUR”, “USD”, etc.).
- `{{syminfo.basecurrency}}` - Returns the base currency code of the current symbol if the symbol refers to a currency pair. Otherwise, it returns `na`. For example, it returns “EUR” when the symbol is “EURUSD”.

### Pine Script Maps

Maps are collections that hold elements in the form of key-value pairs. They associate unique keys of a fundamental type with values of a built-in or user-defined type. Unlike arrays, these collections are unordered and do not utilize an internal lookup index. Instead, scripts access the values of maps by referencing the keys from the key-value pairs put into them. For more information on these new collections, see our User Manual’s page on Maps.


## July 2023

### —

Fixed an issue that caused strategies to occasionally calculate the sizes of limit orders incorrectly due to improper tick rounding of the `limit` price.
Added a new built-in variable to the `strategy.*` namespace:
- `strategy.margin_liquidation_price` - When a strategy uses margin, returns the price value after which a margin call will occur.


## June 2023

### —

New `syminfo.*` built-in variables were added:
- `syminfo.sector` - Returns the sector of the symbol.
- `syminfo.industry` - Returns the industry of the symbol.
- `syminfo.country` - Returns the two-letter code of the country where the symbol is traded.
A new display parameter for all `input.*()` functions was added. It provides you with more control over the display of input values next to a script's name. Four arguments can be used: `display.status_line`, `display.data_window`, `display.all`, and `display.none`. Combinations of these arguments using plus or minus signs are allowed, and regardless of the argument used, input values will always continue to appear in the `Inputs` tab of the script’s settings.


## May 2023

### —

New parameter added to the `strategy.entry()`, `strategy.order()`, `strategy.close()`, `strategy.close_all()`, and `strategy.exit()` functions:
- `disable_alert` - Disables order fill alerts for any orders placed by the function.
Our “Indicator on indicator” feature, which allows a script to pass another indicator's plot as a source value via the `input.source()` function, now supports multiple external inputs. Scripts can use a multitude of external inputs originating from up to 10 different indicators.
We've added the following array functions:
- `array.every()` - Returns `true` if all elements of the `id` array are `true`, `false` otherwise.
- `array.some()` - Returns `true` if at least one element of the `id` array is `true`, `false` otherwise. These functions also work with arrays of `int` and `float` types, in which case zero values are considered `false`, and all others `true`.


## April 2023

### —

Fixed an issue with trailing stops in `strategy.exit()` being filled on high/low prices rather than on intrabar prices.
Fixed behavior of `array.mode()`, `matrix.mode()` and `ta.mode()`. Now these functions will return the smallest value when the data has no most frequent value.


## March 2023

### —

It is now possible to use seconds-based timeframe strings for the `timeframe` parameter in `request.security()` and `request.security_lower_tf()`.
A new function was added:
- `request.currency_rate()` - provides a daily rate to convert a value expressed in the `from` currency to another in the `to` currency.


## February 2023

### Pine Script Methods

Pine Script methods are specialized functions associated with specific instances of built-in or user-defined types. They offer a more convenient syntax than standard functions, as users can access methods in the same way as object fields using the handy dot notation syntax. Pine Script includes built-in methods for `array`, `matrix`, `line`, `linefill`, `label`, `box`, and `table` types and facilitates user-defined methods with the new `method` keyword. For more details on this new feature, see our User Manual’s page on methods.


## January 2023

### —

New array functions were added:
- `array.first()` - Returns the array's first element.
- `array.last()` - Returns the array's last element.


## December 2022

### Pine Objects

Pine objects are instantiations of the new user-defined composite types (UDTs) declared using the `type` keyword. Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as method-less classes. They allow users to create custom types that organize different values under one logical entity. A detailed rundown of the new functionality can be found in our User Manual's page on objects.
A new function was added:
- `ticker.standard()` - Creates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is unaffected by modifiers like extended session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart types: Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.
New `strategy.*` functions were added:
- `strategy.opentrades.entry_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the open trade's entry.
- `strategy.closedtrades.entry_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the closed trade's entry.
- `strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the closed trade's exit.


## November 2022

Pine Script now has a new, more powerful and better-integrated editor. Read our blog to find out everything to know about all the new features and upgrades.
New overload for the `fill()` function was added. Now it can create vertical gradients. More info about it in the blog post.
A new function was added:
- `str.format_time()` - Converts a timestamp to a formatted string using the specified format and time zone.


## September 2022

### —

The `text_font_family` parameter now allows the selection of a monospace font in `label.new()`, `box.new()` and `table.cell()` function calls, which makes it easier to align text vertically. Its arguments can be:
- `font.family_default` - Specifies the default font.
- `font.family_monospace` - Specifies a monospace font.
The accompanying setter functions are:
- `label.set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the label.
- `box.set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the box.
- `table.cell_set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the cell.


## August 2022

### —

A new label style `label.style_text_outline` was added.
A new parameter for the `ta.pivot_point_levels()` function was added:
- `developing` - If `false`, the values are those calculated the last time the anchor condition was true. They remain constant until the anchor condition becomes true again. If `true`, the pivots are developing, i.e., they constantly recalculate on the data developing between the point of the last anchor (or bar zero if the anchor condition was never true) and the current bar. Cannot be `true` when `type` is set to `"Woodie"`.
A new parameter for the `box.new()` function was added:
- `text_wrap` - It defines whether the text is presented in a single line, extending past the width of the box if necessary, or wrapped so every line is no wider than the box itself.
This parameter supports two arguments:
- `text.wrap_none` - Disabled wrapping mode for `box.new` and `box.set_text_wrap` functions.
- `text.wrap_auto` - Automatic wrapping mode for `box.new` and `box.set_text_wrap` functions.
New built-in functions were added:
- `ta.min()` - Returns the all-time low value of `source` from the beginning of the chart up to the current bar.
- `ta.max()` - Returns the all-time high value of `source` from the beginning of the chart up to the current bar.
A new annotation `//@strategy_alert_message` was added. If the annotation is added to the strategy, the text written after it will be automatically set as the default alert message in the [Create Alert] window.


## July 2022

It is now possible to fine-tune where a script's plot values are displayed through the introduction of new arguments for the `display` parameter of the `plot()`, `plotchar()`, `plotshape()`, `plotarrow()`, `plotcandle()`, and `plotbar()` functions.
Four new arguments were added, complementing the previously available `display.all` and `display.none`:
- `display.data_window` displays the plot values in the Data Window, one of the items available from the chart's right sidebar.
- `display.pane` displays the plot in the pane where the script resides, as defined in with the `overlay` parameter of the script's `indicator()`, `strategy()`, or `library()` declaration statement.
- `display.price_scale` controls the display of the plot's label and price in the price scale, if the chart's settings allow them.
- `display.status_line` displays the plot values in the script's status line, next to the script's name on the chart, if the chart's settings allow them.
The `display` parameter supports the addition and subtraction of its arguments:
- `display.all - display.status_line` will display the plot's information everywhere except in the script's status line.
- `display.price_scale + display.status_line` will display the plot in the price scale and status line only.


## June 2022

The behavior of the argument used with the `qty_percent` parameter of `strategy.exit()` has changed. Previously, the percentages used on successive exit orders of the same position were calculated from the remaining position at any given time. Instead, the percentages now always apply to the initial position size. When executing the following strategy, for example:
20% of the initial position will be closed on each `strategy.exit()` call. Before, the first call would exit 20% of the initial position, and the second would exit 20% of the remaining 80% of the position, so only 16% of the initial position.
Two new parameters for the built-in `ta.vwap()` function were added:
- `anchor` - Specifies the condition that triggers the reset of VWAP calculations. When `true`, calculations reset; when `false`, calculations proceed using the values accumulated since the previous reset.
- `stdev_mult` - If specified, the `ta.vwap()` calculates the standard deviation bands based on the main VWAP series and returns a `[vwap, upper_band, lower_band]` tuple.
New overloaded versions of the `strategy.close()` and `strategy.close_all()` functions with the `immediately` parameter. When `immediately` is set to `true`, the closing order will be executed on the tick where it has been placed, ignoring the strategy parameters that restrict the order execution to the open of the next bar.
New built-in functions were added:
- `timeframe.change()` - Returns `true` on the first bar of a new `timeframe`, `false` otherwise.
- `ta.pivot_point_levels()` - Returns a float array with numerical values representing 11 pivot point levels: `[P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5]`. Levels absent from the specified `type` return na values.
New built-in variables were added:
- `session.isfirstbar` - returns `true` if the current bar is the first bar of the day's session, `false` otherwise.
- `session.islastbar` - returns `true` if the current bar is the last bar of the day's session, `false` otherwise.
- `session.isfirstbar_regular` - returns `true` on the first regular session bar of the day, `false` otherwise.
- `session.islastbar_regular` - returns `true` on the last regular session bar of the day, `false` otherwise.
- `chart.left_visible_bar_time` - returns the `time` of the leftmost bar currently visible on the chart.
- `chart.right_visible_bar_time` - returns the `time` of the rightmost bar currently visible on the chart.


## May 2022

New built-in variables were added:
- `chart.bg_color` - Returns the color of the chart's background from the `"Chart settings/Appearance/Background"` field.
- `chart.fg_color` - Returns a color providing optimal contrast with `chart.bg_color`.
- `chart.is_standard` - Returns true if the chart type is bars, candles, hollow candles, line, area or baseline, false otherwise.

- `request.security_lower_tf()` - requests data from a lower timeframe than the chart's.
Added `use_bar_magnifier` parameter for the `strategy()` function. When `true`, the Broker Emulator uses lower timeframe data during history backtesting to achieve more realistic results.
Fixed behaviour of `strategy.exit()` function when stop loss triggered at prices outside the bars price range.
Added new `comment` and `alert` message parameters for the `strategy.exit()` function:
- `comment_profit` - additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `profit` or `limit` specifically.
- `comment_loss` - additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `stop` or `loss` specifically.
- `comment_trailing` - additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `trail_offset` specifically.
- `alert_profit` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `profit` or `limit` specifically.
- `alert_loss` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `stop` or `loss` specifically.
- `alert_trailing` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `trail_offset` specifically.

### Table merging and cell tooltips

- It is now possible to merge several cells in a table. A merged cell doesn't have to be a header: you can merge cells in any direction, as long as the resulting cell doesn't affect any already merged cells and doesn't go outside of the table's bounds. Cells can be merged with the new `table.merge_cells()` function.
- Tables now support tooltips, floating labels that appear when you hover over a table's cell. To add a tooltip, pass a string to the `tooltip` argument of the `table.cell()` function or use the new `table.cell_set_tooltip()` function.


## February 2022

Added new functions to clone drawings:
- `line.copy()`
- `label.copy()`
- `box.copy()`


## December 2021

### Linefills

The space between lines drawn in Pine Script can now be filled! We've added a new `linefill` drawing type, along with a number of functions dedicated to manipulating it. Linefills are created by passing two lines and a color to the `linefill.new()` function, and their behavior is based on the lines they're tied to: they extend in the same direction as the lines, move when their lines move, and are deleted when one of the two lines is deleted.
New linefill-related functions:
- `array.new_linefill()`
- `linefill()`
- `linefill.delete()`
- `linefill.get_line1()`
- `linefill.get_line2()`
- `linefill.new()`
- `linefill.set_color()`
- `linefill.all()`

### New functions for string manipulation

Added a number of new functions that provide more ways to process strings, and introduce regular expressions to Pine Script:
- `str.contains(source, str)` - Determines if the `source` string contains the `str` substring.
- `str.pos(source, str)` - Returns the position of the `str` string in the `source` string.
- `str.substring(source, begin_pos, end_pos)` - Extracts a substring from the `source` string.
- `str.replace(source, target, replacement, occurrence)` - Contrary to the existing `str.replace_all()` function, `str.replace()` allows the selective replacement of a matched substring with a replacement string.
- `str.lower(source)` and `str.upper(source)` - Convert all letters of the `source` string to lower or upper case:
- `str.startswith(source, str)` and `str.endswith(source, str)` - Determine if the `source` string starts or ends with the `str` substring.
- `str.match(source, regex)` - Extracts the substring matching the specified regular expression.

### Textboxes

Box drawings now supports text. The `box.new()` function has five new parameters for text manipulation: `text`, `text_size`, `text_color`, `text_valign`, and `text_halign`. Additionally, five new functions to set the text properties of existing boxes were added:
- `box.set_text()`
- `box.set_text_color()`
- `box.set_text_size()`
- `box.set_text_valign()`
- `box.set_text_halign()`

### New built-in variables

Added new built-in variables that return the `bar_index` and `time` values of the last bar in the dataset. Their values are known at the beginning of the script's calculation:
- `last_bar_index` - Bar index of the last chart bar.
- `last_bar_time` - UNIX time of the last chart bar.
New built-in `source` variable:
- `hlcc4` - A shortcut for `(high + low + close + close)/4`. It averages the high and low values with the double-weighted close.


## November 2021

### for…in

Added a new `for…in` operator to iterate over all elements of an array:

### Function overloads

Added function overloads. Several functions in a script can now share the same name, as long one of the following conditions is true:
- Each overload has a different number of parameters:
- When overloads have the same number of parameters, all parameters in each overload must be explicitly typified, and their type combinations must be unique:

### Currency conversion

Added a new [currency] argument to most `request.*()` functions. If specified, price values returned by the function will be converted from the source currency to the target currency. The following functions are affected:
- `request.dividends()`
- `request.earnings()`

Pine Script v5 is here! This is a list of the new features added to the language, and a few of the changes made. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for a complete list of the changes in v5.

### New features

Libraries are a new type of publication. They allow you to create custom functions for reuse in other scripts. See this manual's page on Libraries.
Pine Script now supports `switch` structures! They provide a more convenient and readable alternative to long ternary operators and `if` statements.
`while` loops are here! They allow you to create a loop that will only stop when its controlling condition is false, or a `break` command is used in the loop.
New built-in array variables are maintained by the Pine Script runtime to hold the IDs of all the active objects of the same type drawn by your script. They are `label.all`, `line.all`, `box.all` and `table.all`.
The `runtime.error()` function makes it possible to halt the execution of a script and display a runtime error with a custom message. You can use any condition in your script to trigger the call.
Parameter definitions in user-defined functions can now include a default value: a function defined as `f(x = 1) => x` will return 1 when called as `f()`, i.e., without providing an argument for its `x` parameter.
New variables and functions provide better script visibility on strategy information:
- `strategy.closedtrades.entry_price()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_price()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.entry_time()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_time()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.size()` and `strategy.opentrades.size()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.profit()` and `strategy.opentrades.profit()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.commission()` and `strategy.opentrades.commission()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.max_runup()` and `strategy.opentrades.max_runup()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown()` and `strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()`
- `strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()`
- `strategy.convert_to_account()`
- `strategy.convert_to_symbol()`
- `strategy.account_currency`
A new `earnings.standardized` constant for the `request.earnings()` function allows requesting standardized earnings data.
A v4 to v5 converter is now included in the Pine Script Editor. See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for more information on converting your scripts to v5.
The `Reference Manual` now includes the systematic mention of the form and type (e.g., “simple int”) required for each function parameter.
The User Manual was reorganized and new content was added.

### Changes

Many built-in variables, functions and function arguments were renamed or moved to new namespaces in v5. The venerable `study()`, for example, is now `indicator()`, and `security()` is now `request.security()`. New namespaces now group related functions and variables together. This consolidation implements a more rational nomenclature and provides an orderly space to accommodate the many additions planned for Pine Script.
See the Pine Script v5 Migration guide for a complete list of the changes made in v5.


## September 2021

### —

New parameter has been added for the `dividends()`, `earnings()`, `financial()`, `quandl()`, `security()`, and `splits()` functions:
- `ignore_invalid_symbol` - determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if `false`, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if `true`, the function will return `na` and execution will continue.


## July 2021

### —

`tostring` now accepts “bool” and “string” types.
New argument for `time` and `time_close` functions was added:
- `timezone` - timezone of the `session` argument, can only be used when a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation (e.g. “GMT-5”) or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g. “America/New_York”).
It is now possible to place a drawing object in the future with `xloc = xloc.bar_index`.
New argument for `study` and `strategy` functions was added:
- `explicit_plot_zorder` - specifies the order in which the indicator's plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, the plots will be drawn based on the order in which they appear in the indicator's code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous ones.


## June 2021

### —

New variable was added:
- `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory` - returns `true` if script is executing on the dataset's last bar when market is closed, or script is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time bar, if market is open. Returns `false` otherwise.
New function was added:
- `round_to_mintick(x)` - returns the value rounded to the symbol's mintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by `syminfo.mintick`, without the remainder, with ties rounding up.
Expanded `tostring()` functionality. The function now accepts three new formatting arguments:
- `format.mintick` to format to tick precision.
- `format.volume` to abbreviate large values.
- `format.percent` to format percentages.


## May 2021

### —

Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism.
Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them. Tables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they float in a script’s space, independently of the chart bars being viewed or the zoom factor used. For more information, see the Tables User Manual page.
New functions were added:
- `color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp)` - creates a new color with transparency using the RGB color model.
- `color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)` - returns color calculated from the linear gradient between bottom_color to top_color.
- `color.r(color)`, `color.g(color)`, `color.b(color)`, `color.t(color)` - retrieves the value of one of the color components.
- `array.from()` - takes a variable number of arguments with one of the types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `label`, `line`, `color`, `box`, `table` and returns an array of the corresponding type.
A new `box` drawing has been added to Pine Script, making it possible to draw rectangles on charts using the Pine Script syntax. For more details, see the Pine Script reference entry for `box.new()` and the Lines and boxes User Manual page.
The `color.new` function can now accept series and input arguments, in which case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more information about this, see our Colors User Manual page.


## April 2021

### —

New math constants were added:
- `math.pi` - is a named constant for Archimedes' constant. It is equal to 3.1415926535897932.
- `math.phi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal to 1.6180339887498948.
- `math.rphi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It is equal to 0.6180339887498948.
- `math.e` - is a named constant for Euler's number. It is equal to 2.7182818284590452.
New math functions were added:
- `round(x, precision)` - returns the value of `x` rounded to the nearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter is used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal places.
- `median(source, length)` - returns the median of the series.
- `mode(source, length)` - returns the mode of the series. If there are several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest value.
- `range(source, length)` - returns the difference between the `min` and `max` values in a series.
- `todegrees(radians)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in degrees from an angle measured in radians.
- `toradians(degrees)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in radians from an angle measured in degrees.
- `random(min, max, seed)` - returns a pseudorandom value. The function will generate a different sequence of values for each script execution. Using the same value for the optional seed argument will produce a repeatable sequence.
New functions were added:
- `session.ismarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part of the regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), `false` otherwise.
- `session.ispremarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part of the pre-market, `false` otherwise.
- `session.ispostmarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part of the post-market, `false` otherwise.
- `str.format` - converts the values to strings based on the specified formats. Accepts certain `number` modifiers: `integer`, `currency`, `percent`.

New argument for `fill` function was added:
- `fillgaps` - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the `plot` calls returns an `na` value.
A new keyword was added:
- `varip` - is similar to the `var` keyword, but variables declared with `varip` retain their values between the updates of a real-time bar.
New functions were added:
- `tonumber()` - converts a string value into a float.
- `time_close()` - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the current bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to the function.

- Pine Script v3 is here! Some important changes: Changes to the default behavior of the `security()` function: it can no longer access the future data by default. This can be changes with the `lookahead` parameter. An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was replaced with an implicit conversion of numeric values (integer and float) to boolean values. Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed. Any PineScript code that used those language constructions can be equivalently rewritten using mutable variables.


## February 2017

### —

- Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report: New Buy & Hold equity graph – a new graph that lets you compare performance of your strategy versus a “buy and hold”, i.e if you just bought a security and held onto it without trading. Added percentage values to the absolute currency values. Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold Equity based on last price. Added Sharpe Ratio – it shows the relative effectiveness of the investment portfolio (security), a measure that indicates the average return minus the risk-free return divided by the standard deviation of return on an investment. Slippage lets you simulate a situation when orders are filled at a worse price than expected. It can be set through the Properties dialog or through the `slippage` argument in the `strategy()` function.

Strategies allow you to perform backtesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and forward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data) according to your algorithms. Detailed information about the strategy's calculations and the order fills can be seen in the newly added Strategy Tester tab.


## July 2015

### —

- A new `editable` parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style menu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit its style. The parameter has been added to all the following functions: all plot-type functions, `barcolor()`, `bgcolor()`, `hline()`, and `fill()`.


## June 2015
