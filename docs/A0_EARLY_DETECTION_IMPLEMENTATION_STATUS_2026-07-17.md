# A0 early detection implementation status — 2026-07-17

## Implemented locally

- Versioned A0 volume semantics, provider-neutral decision contract, golden
  replay cases, latency telemetry, Databento-style stream state, recovery,
  parity storage and bounded load behavior.
- Deterministic PRE-A0 trailing features, robust multi-window ETA,
  `NONE/WATCH/BUILDING/IMMINENT` hysteresis and a payload that cannot represent
  confirmed A0 or calibrated probability.
- Horizon outcomes, atomic partitioned snapshot dataset, censor-aware labels,
  machine-readable leakage audit and deterministic sealed day splits.
- Base rate, deterministic logistic baseline, Platt calibration, Brier/ECE,
  versioned model artifact and fail-closed shadow inference.
- Timestamp-bounded volume-profile, microstructure, news and opening-auction
  contracts, bounded warm set and common ablation gate.
- Independent flags, deployment approval gates, alert budget, telemetry, alert
  rules and separate A0-Fast/PRE-A0 rollback runbooks.

## Deliberately not claimed

The code foundation does not manufacture empirical evidence. The following
gates remain open until representative real sessions and approved provider
inputs exist:

- 20+ session A0-Fast parity and stability evidence;
- representative positive, negative and censored PRE-A0 corpus;
- untouched walk-forward comparison proving a model beats base rate and ETA;
- valid calibration and slice stability on final/shadow windows;
- provider-specific microstructure, Benzinga and auction ablation reports;
- any `active` or `notify` deployment.

Therefore the safe operational default remains `off`. Shadow/observe are local
capabilities; active notification or production promotion requires a separate,
explicit deployment decision after the evidence gates pass.
