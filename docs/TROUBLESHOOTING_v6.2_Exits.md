# Troubleshooting Log: Premature Exit Fixes (v6.2 Patch)

**Date:** 06 Feb 2026
**Status:** FIXED
**Commits:** `63e4ef2`, `2bc3b8f`, `ca5ad41`, `09fcd61`

## Problem Description

Users reported high-confidence BUY signals (e.g., at 21:48) followed immediately by exits (e.g., at 21:51) on lower timeframes (3m). These exits appeared to be "wick-outs" caused by minor market noise rather than genuine trend reversals, undermining the Algo's entry logic.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Tight Calibration Targets**: The Risk Model was initially coupled to the logic used for ML Calibration (`0.5 ATR` targets). While good for training data, these are too tight for live execution.
2. **Structural Sensitivity**: The "Trend Flip" logic (Structural Exit) was reacting instantly to minor pullbacks in the first few bars of a trade.
3. **Risk Parameter Safety**: The default Safety Stop (`1.5 ATR`) was too tight for volatile entry conditions, triggering "Hard Stops" on normal wicks.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Exit Grace Period (Structural Protection)

* **Change**: Introduced `exitGraceBars` input.
* **Logic**: Structural Exits (Trend Flips/EMA Crosses) are completely **IGNORED** for the first **5 bars** of a trade.
* **Effect**: Allows the trade room to "breathe" and establish direction without being stopped out by immediate noise/chop.
* **Code**:

    ```pine
    bool canStructExit = (barsSinceEntry > exitGraceBars)
    ```

### 2. Widened Risk Parameters (Execution Safety)

* **Change**: Decoupled Execution Stops from Calibration Targets and significantly widened defaults.
* **New Defaults**:
  * **Stop Loss**: `2.5 ATR` (was 1.5)
  * **Take Profit**: `5.0 ATR` (was 3.0)
  * **Trailing Stop**: `2.5 ATR` (was 2.0)
  * **Trail Activation**: `1.5 R` (was 1.0)
* **Effect**: Moves the "Catastrophe Stop" much lower. The trade is now primarily managed by the Structural Exit (after the grace period), with the Hard Stop serving only as emergency protection.

### 3. Diagnostic Instrumentation

* **Change**: Added explicit reason codes to Exit Labels on the chart.
* **Labels**:
  * `EXIT (SL)`: Hard Stop hit.
  * `EXIT (TP)`: Take Profit hit.
  * `EXIT (Trail)`: Trailing Stop hit.
  * `EXIT (Struct)`: Trend Flip / Signal Reversal.
* **Benefit**: Allows instant visual debugging of *why* an exit occurred.

### 4. Dynamic Risk Decay (Smart Risk Management)

* **Feature Added**: Automatically tightens risk parameters after the trade stabilizes.
* **Mechanism**:
  1. **Phase 1 (Entry)**: Uses Wide Stops (`2.5 ATR`) to survive initial noise.
  2. **Phase 2 (Sustained)**: After `Grace Period` ends, stops snap to tighter values (`1.5 ATR`).
* **Result**: Provides "Safety" of a wide stop during volatility, but ensures "Discipline" of a tight stop during trend maintenance.

## Verification & Case Study

* **Test Case**: 21:15 Entry on 3m Chart.
* **Previous Behavior**: Exited immediately at 21:18 (Loss) due to `0.5 ATR` noise wicks or tight structural reactions.
* **New Behavior**:
  1. **Entry 21:15**: Wide Stop (2.5 ATR) absorbs the initial wick.
  2. **Grace Period**: Trade ignores structural flips through 21:30 (5 bars).
  3. **Risk Decay**: At 21:30, TP target automatically reduces from 5.0 &rarr; 3.0 ATR.
  4. **Outcome**: Valid Exit at **21:42 (EXIT TP)**.
* **Conclusion**: The logic correction turned a "Technical Stop-Out" into a "Realized Profit". The trade was allowed to breathe, survived the noise, and hit the target.
