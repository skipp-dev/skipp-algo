# Troubleshooting Log: Premature Exit Fixes (v6.2 Patch)

**Date:** 06 Feb 2026
**Status:** FIXED
**Commits:** `63e4ef2`, `2bc3b8f`, `ca5ad41`, `09fcd61`

## Problem Description
Users reported high-confidence BUY signals (e.g., at 21:48) followed immediately by exits (e.g., at 21:51) on lower timeframes (3m). These exits appeared to be "wick-outs" caused by minor market noise rather than genuine trend reversals, undermining the Algo's entry logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
1.  **Tight Calibration Targets**: The Risk Model was initially coupled to the logic used for ML Calibration (`0.5 ATR` targets). While good for training data, these are too tight for live execution.
2.  **Structural Sensitivity**: The "Trend Flip" logic (Structural Exit) was reacting instantly to minor pullbacks in the first few bars of a trade.
3.  **Risk Parameter Safety**: The default Safety Stop (`1.5 ATR`) was too tight for volatile entry conditions, triggering "Hard Stops" on normal wicks.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Exit Grace Period (Structural Protection)
*   **Change**: Introduced `exitGraceBars` input.
*   **Logic**: Structural Exits (Trend Flips/EMA Crosses) are completely **IGNORED** for the first **5 bars** of a trade.
*   **Effect**: Allows the trade room to "breathe" and establish direction without being stopped out by immediate noise/chop.
*   **Code**:
    ```pine
    bool canStructExit = (barsSinceEntry > exitGraceBars)
    ```

### 2. Widened Risk Parameters (Execution Safety)
*   **Change**: Decoupled Execution Stops from Calibration Targets and significantly widened defaults.
*   **New Defaults**:
    *   **Stop Loss**: `2.5 ATR` (was 1.5)
    *   **Take Profit**: `5.0 ATR` (was 3.0)
    *   **Trailing Stop**: `2.5 ATR` (was 2.0)
    *   **Trail Activation**: `1.5 R` (was 1.0)
*   **Effect**: Moves the "Catastrophe Stop" much lower. The trade is now primarily managed by the Structural Exit (after the grace period), with the Hard Stop serving only as emergency protection.

### 3. Diagnostic Instrumentation
*   **Change**: Added explicit reason codes to Exit Labels on the chart.
*   **Labels**:
    *   `EXIT (SL)`: Hard Stop hit.
    *   `EXIT (TP)`: Take Profit hit.
    *   `EXIT (Trail)`: Trailing Stop hit.
    *   `EXIT (Struct)`: Trend Flip / Signal Reversal.
*   **Benefit**: Allows instant visual debugging of *why* an exit occurred.

## Verification
*   **Test Case**: 21:15 Trade on 3m Chart.
*   **Result**: The trade now survives the initial volatility due to the 2.5 ATR stop width and 5-bar grace period.

## Files Updated
*   `SkippALGO.pine` (Indicator)
*   `SkippALGO_Strategy.pine` (Strategy)
